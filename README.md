**Project Description: Sports Quiz Web Application**
The Sports Quiz Web Application is an interactive and engaging browser-based quiz tool designed to test users' knowledge of Indian and international sports. Built using core web technologies, this application offers a sleek interface, real-time feedback, score tracking, and result analysis — all within a responsive and user-friendly environment.

**Platform Used: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**
The entire development process was carried out in Visual Studio Code, one of the most popular code editors among developers. 
**The reason why I choose vs code:**
IntelliSense for smart code completion
Syntax highlighting and auto-formatting
File and folder structure navigation for managing HTML, CSS, JS, and media assets
VS Code’s integration with Git and its debugging capabilities also make it an ideal environment for building interactive web projects like this quiz.

**Idea Behind the Project**
The inspiration for this quiz came from the need to create an educational yet entertaining way to raise awareness and interest in Indian sports achievements and Olympic milestones. With events like the Olympics and FIFA gaining massive popularity in India, this quiz aims to:
Promote learning through gamification
Provide a self-assessment tool for students or sports enthusiasts
Encourage repeated engagement with immediate feedback and retake options
Showcase web development skills using basic technologies

**Tools & Technologies Used**
This project was developed using the core building blocks of web development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**HTML5** was used to structure the content of the web page — defining the quiz section, result box, navigation bar, and popup guide.

**CSS3** handled all the styling, including layout, button styles, colors, and transitions, making the interface visually appealing.

**JavaScript** was the backbone of interactivity. It controlled quiz logic like question display, answer validation, score calculation, result display, and real-time user feedback.
JavaScript also enabled dynamic DOM manipulation, which means that questions and options appear on-screen without reloading the page. This makes the application seamless and responsive to user input.

**Features of the Application**

The quiz consists of five sports-related questions, each with four multiple-choice options. Users can:

1.Start the quiz through a guided popup

2.Receive instant feedback upon selecting an answer

3.View their score and percentage with a circular progress animation

4.Retake the quiz as many times as they like

5.Return to the home page and start fresh

6.All incorrect answers are visually marked, and the correct answer is auto-highlighted, helping users learn from their mistakes.

**User Experience (UX) Focus**

The application is designed with a clean interface, simple navigation, and a linear quiz flow. From starting the quiz to viewing results, every step is smooth, intuitive, and beginner-friendly.
The use of animations and button transitions enhances engagement. While currently optimized for desktops, it can be made mobile-friendly with media queries**.
